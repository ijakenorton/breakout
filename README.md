# BREAKOUT

Simple breakout clone written in C using Raylib

## Installation

Currently only running on Linux, linked statically with the raylib library.

To run:
```
git clone git@github.com:ijakenorton/breakout.git
cd breakout
make
make run
```

There are now two basic levels, and paddle rotation with better bouncing!
